This assignment requires using code to light up the Lilypad with different colors, and the colors are picked randomly and only appear when a switch is being pressed. 

The light lit up three different ways.

One trick I would give myself is that touching the alligator clips works the same as connecting the alligator clips to the button and then pressing the button.
