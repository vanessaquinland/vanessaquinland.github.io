Hi everyone! My name is Vanessa Quinland. I am a Williams student and a member of the class of 2022. I used to be decently good at sewing but have not done it in many years, so we'll see how it goes :). I have no programming experience, but I am extremely excited to get to learn as much as I can about it. One boring fact about me is that I have horrible eyesight but I never actually wear them outside of class.
