This is the paper protoype for my final project. The project is a shirt that will tell you whether or not you are overheating when you touch a heat sensor, if the switch is on. If you are the lights and the buzzer will turn on. The paper prototype outlines where the parts will be sewn on and connected with conductive thread.
