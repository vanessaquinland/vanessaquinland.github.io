This assignment is using atom in order to create a code that will print RED three times, GREEN three times and BLUE three time repeatedly until a set limit This is done by creating a loop using conditions. 

This is the code's output when the runtime < 100.

One hint I would give myself is to make sure that the second line that updates the second variable ,in this case color=color+1, is written in each of the if statements so it only increases when the code prints something.Â
