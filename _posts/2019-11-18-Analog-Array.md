This project requires using an array in order to get LEDs to light up in a random sequence. The LED will only turn off once it had been picked randomly again. 


One hint I would use is to remember that I have already defined the variables in the beginning of the code. Sometimes I would forget and rewrite the same things I had already written, just in a different way.
