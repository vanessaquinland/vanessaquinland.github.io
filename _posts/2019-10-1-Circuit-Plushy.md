 This assignment challenged us to combine circuitry and textile work for the first time. We put LED lights along with a battery, a switch and a button in order to make the lights light up inside of the plushy. We then connected them with conductive thread and sewed the plushy closed using normal thread.

One hint I would suggest is to make sure that your knots are on the same side of the plushy as your stitching when you begin, in order to make it look cleaner.
