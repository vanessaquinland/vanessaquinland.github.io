This assignenment asked us to create a code that would say what to wear in different temperature conditions. We were tasked to create this code using if, if else, and else statements.  
A tip I would give to myself would be to not overcomplicate the code. I initially made it too difficult for myself before taking a step back and realizing that was what I was doing.  

This is my output if the weather is 0 degrees or below.

This is my output if the weather is in between 0 and 50 degrees.

This is my output if the weather is above 50 degrees.
