This assignment requires using nested ifs in our code in order not only what menu we would get, but different options under the different menus. If the number choice is even the regular menu will come up. If the number choice is odd the secret menu will come up. 

The Regular Menu

The Secret Menu

![odd and meal choice 2](/img/Champagne.png)
![odd and meal choice 3](/img/Lobster.png)

A tip of hint I would give to my past self is to keep track on the opened and closed curly braces by hovering over them to see which other brace they correspond to.
