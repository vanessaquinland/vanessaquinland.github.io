Vanessa's Light Up and Buzzing Work Out Tee

This shirt will light up and start buzzing when the switch is on and the temperature sensor reads a high enough temperature.  

Often I will become overheated while working out and not realize until it is too late. This shirt will help me be able to work out and not have to worry that am getting too warm. 

Materials Used: Conductive Thread,T-shirt, Fabric, Thread, Needle, Fabric Scissors, LilyPad Arduino, LilyPad Temperature Sensor, LilyPad LED Lights, LilyPad Buzzer, LilyPad Switch.

3 Tips to My Past Self:
1)When coding, keep in mind where the components will be on the project when considering what port to use. When I didn't there was a lot of wire crossing. 
2)Remember that the temperature sensor should be written out to an analog output. 
3)Try and make the length of the conductive thread as short as possible in order to make the most amount of power go into the pieces.
