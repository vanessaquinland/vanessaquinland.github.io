This assignment is using conductive thread, conductive fabric, and fabric patches in order to create a close circuit that will light up an LED.

One tip I would give myself is to not overestimate the amount of conductive thread I would need to cut. I expected to use more than I did when cutting off segments, and it made it more difficult to use as well as wasted extra thread in the end.
